About SVGQuartzRenderer
SVGQuartzRenderer is a basic SVG renderer written in Obj-C that uses CoreGraphics to render SVG files. The goal of SVGQuartzRenderer is to be a simple drop-in SVG renderer that is compatible with the iPhone platform.
For the time being the idea is that it should consist of as few source files as poissible, so that the source can simple be dragged into an existing project.
